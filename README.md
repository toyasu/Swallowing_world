# Swallowing App:bird: 
:bulb:The "swallowing app" is aimed at people who want to know what swallow is.<br>

I had worked in the hospital as a speech therapist for 4 years.<br>
Back then, it seemed that many people (including the patient's family) were unaware of the complications that could arise when a patient swallows food or drink.<br>
As a result, caretakers would often cause harm to the patient when attempting to administer care<br>
I made this application to assist caretakers in helping patients without causing them harm.

<br>

From now on, I want to add submit function to debate about the patient who has swallowing disability.<br>
And to read more easily, I'll insert a lot of diagrams.:thought_balloon:
