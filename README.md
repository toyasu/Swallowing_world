# swallowing world
 
The "swallowing app" is aimed at people who want to know what swallow is.<br>

I had worked in the hospital as a speech therapist for 4 years.<br>
On that ocation I thought everyone don't know enough about swallowing(include patient's family).<br>
It's only natural,they commited dagerous acts against patients because of they don't know about that.<br>
So I made this application because I want them to know whichever or not their assistance is safety.<br>

From now on, I want to add submit function to debate about the patient who has swallowing disability.<br>
And to read more easily, I'll insert a lot of diagrams.
